#summary HOUnityLibs usage.
#labels Featured

As of now, HOUnityLibs is composed of 3 projects, each of which generates a separate and independent assembly (you can find the compiled files inside each bin directory). It is still in alpha: everything works, and I will add stuff to it while I go on, but it's yet to be fully documented and I might change parts of the API.

= HOEditorGUIFramework =

=== HOGUILayout ===
A static class used to draw and layout content, inspired by [https://twitter.com/brenoazevedo Breno Azevedo]'s GUILayout alternative. It contains various methods to draw special GUI elements (drag&drop areas, buttons, toolbars, toggles, foldouts, etc.), and is also meant to replace any Unity vertical/horizontal/disabled GUILayout block, as this examples shows:
{{{
// instead of this:
GUILayout.BeginHorizontal();
/* code lines */
GUILayout.EndHorizontal();

// You can do this
HOGUILayout.Horizontal(() => {
  /* code lines */
});
// Pro: way more readable and less prone to errors
// Con: you can't simply exit an action
}}}

=== HOGUIDrag ===
Allows dragging of elements inside a panel.

=== HOGUIStyle ===
Various ready-made styles to use with the GUI.

=== HOEditorUndoManager ===
Allows to manage undo easily and effectively on every custom panel/window.

=== ExtensionMethods ===
Useful extension methods.
